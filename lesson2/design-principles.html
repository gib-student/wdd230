            <p class="explanation">CVS is a company concerned about the physical health of their customers,
                and so it is appropriate that on their homepage they show pictures
                of family members loving one another, and being happy and healthy. 
                It suggests that their company will help you to live a happy and healthy life.
                These photos span the entire width of the screen, making them 
                visually stand out. Additionally, there are big words 
                superimposed over the photos which tell the viewers
                their mission and company promise.

            <p class="explanation">Between the photos, text, links and other 
                things present on the Apple webpage, there is lots of space. 
                This empty space is effective at causing the things on the site 
                which do occupy space really pop out to the eyes of the viewer.
                They realy send the message: "We have big ideas here at Apple, 
                and we care about simplicity." That is what all of their products
                are centered on: simplicity and user-friendliness. Apple tries
                to tell the people who view their webpage that they spend a LOT 
                of effort on their products, and they speak for themselves. That's
                why we don't need big, long explanations of our products; rather
                just big photos so you can see it.
